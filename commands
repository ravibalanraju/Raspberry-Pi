What are the commands that are used




## Command line list

$sudo raspi-config
raspi-config provides a simple and convenient command line interface to manage the configuration of the Raspberry Pi system, allowing users to easily customize and optimize their system settings.
Then move on to Raspberry-Pi Configurtion Tool and check for updates  

Check while your Rapberry-pi is connected to internet or not 
Once it is connected to the internet then type the command as

$sudo apt update 
This command is used to check if there are any updates available to the current OS (Parrot os )
If there is some files then it asks some sort of space that is required to update if it is ok to the user or not 
To confirm press Y or else press N

$sudo apt upgrade
This command helps to upgrade the update pakages which are all listed above

$sudo apt install dnsmasq hostapd 

The command dnsmasq and hostapd are typically used together to create a wireless access point (AP) on a Linux system
dnsmasq: Manages DNS and DHCP services, handling IP address allocation and local name resolution for devices connecting to the access point.
hostapd (Host Access Point Daemon): Enables the Linux machineâ€™s Wi-Fi interface to function as a wireless access point (AP), allowing other devices to connect wirelessly.

To ensure that the smasq and stapd are upgraded to the latest version

$sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.config 

CHeck the IP address was given correctly so that the connection that we are going to go on is secure

Next step is to move on the masq file to the primary location

$sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.config
paste the following lines in the popped box

interface=eth0 ( or your network that you've connected)
dhcp-range= ip_address
Save the file and exit

$sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.config

To check that each and everything that we are given and connected was correct 
$sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd.config
add daemon_config="/etc/hostpad/hostpad.conf"
