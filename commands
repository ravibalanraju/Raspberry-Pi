Check while your Rapberry-pi is connected to internet or not 
Once it is connected to the internet then type the command as

This command helps to upgrade the update pakages which are all listed above

$sudo apt install dnsmasq hostapd 

The command dnsmasq and hostapd are typically used together to create a wireless access point (AP) on a Linux system
dnsmasq: Manages DNS and DHCP services, handling IP address allocation and local name resolution for devices connecting to the access point.
hostapd (Host Access Point Daemon): Enables the Linux machineâ€™s Wi-Fi interface to function as a wireless access point (AP), allowing other devices to connect wirelessly.

To ensure that the smasq and stapd are upgraded to the latest version

$sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.config 

CHeck the IP address was given correctly so that the connection that we are going to go on is secure
